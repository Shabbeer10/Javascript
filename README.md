## Why I'm Learning JavaScript

JavaScript is essential for web development, and it powers both the client and server side of modern applications (thanks to Node.js). As I aim to become a full-stack developer, understanding JavaScript in all its glory is important for building interactive websites and apps.

## Topics Covered So Far

Here’s a list of topics I’ve covered so far:

- **JavaScript Basics**: Variables, data types, operators, and expressions
- **Control Flow**: `if` statements, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- **Functions**: Function declarations, expressions, arrow functions
- **Objects and Arrays**: Understanding objects and working with arrays
- **DOM Manipulation**: Selecting and modifying elements in the browser
- **Events**: Handling user interactions like clicks, form submissions
- **ES6+ Features**: Let/const, template literals, destructuring, and modules
- **Basic Asynchronous JavaScript**: Callbacks, Promises, `async`/`await`

As I continue learning, I’ll expand this list.
